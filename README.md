# guessing-game-v2

In the file doThis.py, create a new version of the guessing game where you ask the user for a range and choose a number within that range then ask the user to guess the number that was chosen.  

This version of the game will run until the user guesses the number.

During the game, you will let the user know if they should guess higher or lower, and at the end of the game, you will tell them how many times they guessed.

Helpful advice:  
[x] create a variable for the number of guesses and increment whenever a guess is made.
[x] compare the user's guess to the chosen number each time to tell them whether they should guess higher, lower, or have the right number

Sample run:
>Hello user!  Welcome to the Guessing Game v2.  
>I will choose a number and we'll see how many guesses it takes for you to guess the number.
>What's the lowest number you want me to choose from? 2
>What's the highest number you want me to choose from? 6000
>
>Okay, I've chosen a number from 2 - 6000.
>
